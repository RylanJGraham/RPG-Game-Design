<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

My name is Rylan Graham and I am a second year bachelors student in the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. This website is built for information regarding a lecture I delivered about RPG Game Design, or more specifically, the crucial Game Pillars for development.

### What Are Game Pillars?

“What I mean by this term is think about the 3 – 5 main elements/emotions your game is trying to explore and make the players feel” - Max Pears. [Source](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/design-pillars-the-core-of-your-game)

**Game Pillars in Essence**

*A game pillar is a fundamental concept that your game will utilize to function

*Game pillars can vary from mechanics, aesthetics, story, and technology Source

*Game pillars should relate to one another, and should not just be stand alone concepts. 

*Aim for 3-8 concepts for game pillars, however only 3 are essential.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Game Pillar Types

**Common RPG Game Pillars**
- [x] Market Systems


*Market Systems are a form of transaction or trading within the game. Players can trade in-game elements with one another and there is a value system*

- [x] Inventory 

*Players can store items that they collect throughout the game. Players inventories are customizable and personalized.*

- [ ] Visuals

*Players can become fully immersed through impressive or realistic visuals. This can also be through abstract art styles or musical elements.*

- [x] Exploration

*Players can roam the map, and exercise free will on where they move. This adds a level of immersion.*

- [ ] Unique Mechanics

*Some titles feature unique mechanics in regards to physics, combat, movement, and more. These are most popular nowadays as most typical concepts have been exhausted.* 

- [x] Competetive Elements

*Players can fight one another, computer ai, or other in-game elements. 

**RPG Pillar Reliance**

To be a good RPG there is often a reliance on these three pillars existing (even in a small manner) together in harmony. These are all good starting points for our own RPG’s, only we need to specify.

*Choices: Decisions player makes (combat, movement, items, etc)*

*Elements: Items, Abilities, Enemies, etc*

*Plot: Story’s flow and overall thematic Elements*


## Game Pillar Industry Examples

### Pokemon

Pokemon is a game franchise founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. It was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996. The franchise is one of the best selling RPG titles of all time, beginning as Pokemon Red & Blue, and since evolving to include several other titles spanning various consoles, Tv series, Movies, Trading Cards, Apps, & more. However, what Game Pillars make Pokemon such a successful title? The video below seeks to explore that.

**Game Pillar #1: Choice**

Pokemon allows their users to choose among several elements, whether it be their pokemon, exploration area, items etc. The player feels as though the gaming experience is truly customized to them, thus allowing them to add their personality into the game. This is an essential phenomena for a Game Pillar to provide: self-expression. 

**Game Pillar #2: Combat**

Pokemon allows their players to compete with in-game AI, whether it be Pokemon, trainers, or fellow players online. Players can enjoy competition and comparison with others. This is an essential factor, as we as human beings are based on comparison and competition, from a primative standpoint.  

### Final Fantasy Series

[<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pIyfWSrw_FQ/maxresdefault.jpg" width="50%">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIyfWSrw_FQ&t=1s&ab_channel=IGN)

**Game Pillar #1: Visuals**

Final Fantasy has visually stunning visuals as of late. Although less game-oriented or technical, this could be described as a Game Pillar as it adds to the players immersion within the game. Game Pillars are unique elements that keep the player involved, and a visually stunning world to explore is certainly a draw. 


**Game Pillar #2: Combat**

Final Fantasy has a turn-based combat system, a perfect model for RPG's. Players can partake in combat with unique movesets, items, and weaponry. Players are allowed to be creative in their move selection choices, and to be mentally challenged in the challenge, two crucial features of a succesful game pillar. 


**Game Pillar #3: Story**

Final Fantasy has an immersive story that players can dive into. Spanning multiple titles, with hundreds of characters, players can investigate and develop characters story lines. This adds a level of immersion that is essential for Game Pillars. Players are able to establish emotional connections, impacting them even after the game has been exited.
