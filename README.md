<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

My name is Rylan Graham and I am a second year bachelors student in the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. This website is built for information regarding a lecture I delivered about RPG Game Design, or more specifically, the crucial Game Pillars for development. 

“What I mean by this term is think about the 3 – 5 main elements/emotions your game is trying to explore and make the players feel” - Max Pears. [Source](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/design-pillars-the-core-of-your-game)

## Game Pillar Examples

### Pokemon

Pokemon is a game franchise founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. It was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996. The franchise is one of the best selling RPG titles of all time, beginning as Pokemon Red & Blue, and since evolving to include several other titles spanning various consoles, Tv series, Movies, Trading Cards, Apps, & more. However, what Game Pillars make Pokemon such a successful title? The video below seeks to explore that.

**Game Pillar #1: Choice**

Pokemon allows their users to choose among several elements, whether it be their pokemon, exploration area, items etc. The player feels as though the gaming experience is truly customized to them, thus allowing them to add their personality into the game. This is an essential phenomena for a Game Pillar to provide: self-expression. 

**Game Pillar #2: Combat**

Pokemon allows their players to compete with in-game AI, whether it be Pokemon, trainers, or fellow players online. Players can enjoy competition and comparison with others. This is an essential factor, as we as human beings are based on comparison and competition, from a primative standpoint.
